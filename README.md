# 🎵📚 Cross Domain Recommendation System (CDRS)

A final-year B.Tech project that bridges the gap between literature and music using a cross-domain recommender system. This project recommends **music tracks based on book preferences**, enhancing the reader's experience by suggesting thematically-aligned songs using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To build a cross-domain recommender that transfers knowledge from the **Book Domain (source)** to the **Music Domain (target)**, leveraging content-based and collaborative filtering to recommend music aligned with the themes, genres, or moods of books.

## 📂 Tech Stack & Libraries

**Languages:**  
- Python  
- JavaScript (for frontend)

**Libraries & Tools:**  
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `pickle`, `ast`, `itertools`, `random`  
- `Flask` & `flask_cors` for backend API  
- `scipy.sparse` & `sklearn.neighbors` for collaborative filtering  
- `CountVectorizer`, `cosine_similarity` for content-based recommendation  
- `nltk.corpus.wordnet` for genre similarity using NLP  
- `React.js` & `Tailwind CSS` (Frontend integration planned)

---

## 📊 Datasets Used

- 📖 **Books:** [Goodreads Best Books Ever](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/goodreads-best-books-ever)  
- 🎶 **Music:** [Million Song Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/undefinenull/million-song-dataset-spotify-lastfm)

---

## 🔍 Features

### ✅ Phase 1 – Book-to-Book Recommendation (Content-Based)
- Cleaned and preprocessed book metadata.
- Used `CountVectorizer` + `Cosine Similarity` on book genres.
- Recommended similar books based on genre proximity.

### ✅ Phase 2 – Book-to-Music Recommendation (Cross-Domain)
- Extracted and preprocessed genre data from books and music.
- Used `WordNet` from NLTK to find genre-level semantic similarities.
- Mapped books to top-k matching music genres and returned track suggestions.

---

## 🌐 Frontend

- Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS.
- UI pages include:
  - Search interface for books
  - Book details + recommended music tracks
  - Book-to-book and book-to-music flows

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Backend
```bash
cd CDRS_Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
````

### 2. Frontend (Optional)

```bash
# From frontend directory
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add support for hybrid recommendation using multiple book attributes (author, description, characters).
* Improve semantic matching using transformer models like BERT.
* Complete full integration of React + Flask.
* Deploy via Docker and integrate with MongoDB for real-time feedback loops.
